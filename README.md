# GO TSP IRL
The final project for my high school senior computer science class, one of the more enjoyable classes in my 4 years of highschool. This gives a look at the traveling saleman problem in a real life perspective, where a person has to travel to different locations in the real world. Solved with golang.

### Usage
The [main.go](main.go) file has an example getting the shortest distance traveling between 3 locations. Locations can be added, and a minimum of 2 locations must be present for the code to run.
